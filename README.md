# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image
project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI images into multiple categories according to tumor type. It involves building a custom CNN model from scratch. The project also includes deploying a user-friendly Streamlit web application to enable real-time tumor type predictions from uploaded MRI images
